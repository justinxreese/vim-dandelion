{"name":"Vim-dandelion","tagline":"Show subtler color variations than your basic palette-shifting color scheme","body":"# Dandelion\r\n\r\nBased on the vim-detailed coloscheme. Until I write my own README, here is the\r\noriginal:\r\n\r\n# vim-detailed\r\n\r\n![behaving](img/vim-detailed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many 256-color schemes merely shift the palette around, displaying only 8\r\ncolors (even though they're a *different* set of 8 colors than default).\r\n\r\nThis scheme is more detailed than that.\r\n\r\nYour eyes will learn to pick up on subtler patterns without requiring as\r\nmuch from your conscious mind.  Instead of the goal being merely looking\r\ncool, the goal is to maximize info bandwidth from the computer to the brain.\r\nThe regexes, for example, are much easier to pick out. The overall feel of a\r\ngiven file becomes much more intuitively recognizeable (you'll know you're\r\nin foo.rb, not bar.rb, without having to read any text). Certain bits will\r\n\"pop\" into being the right colors, such as the difference between\r\n\"RUBY_VERISON\" and \"RUBY_VERSION\", or # encoding: utf-8\r\n\r\n## 256 Color Requirement\r\n\r\nIf you aren't getting 256 colors, you aren't getting detailed.vim.\r\nTypically, you'll have to make sure your `$TERM` variable is set right. This\r\ncan get un-set by some programs, such as tmux. So you can force it to\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\n    export TERM=screen-256color\r\n    # or:\r\n    export TERM=xterm-256color\r\n\r\nIf these are unavailable on the target system, you might have to place a\r\nterminfo file in `~/.terminfo/`  -or- you can be totally gross and force it\r\nwith `:set &t_Co=256` in vim. But don't be gross. It's uncouth.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\n If using Pathogen,\r\n\r\n     cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone https://github.com/rking/vim-detailed\r\n\r\n If using no vim plugin manager:\r\n\r\n     mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/ && cd $_ && wget https://raw.github.com/rking/vim-detailed/master/colors/detailed.vim\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nIn your ~/.vimrc (or ~/.vim/plugin/colorscheme.vim if you like to organize):\r\n\r\n    colo detailed\r\n\r\nThis enables it globally. If you want to just do it for a trial, as long as\r\nyou have done one of the steps in the \"Download\" section, above, you can do:\r\n\r\n    vim foo.rb +colo\\ detailed\r\n\r\nOr, from within vim:\r\n\r\n    :colo detailed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Language Support So Far\r\n\r\n- Ruby: 113 details detailed.\r\n- C: 12 details detailed.\r\n- Go: 10 details detailed.\r\n- Diff: 10 details detailed.\r\n- Javascript: 4 details detailed.\r\n- Vim: 4 details detailed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that for fully supported languages (Ruby), you get the whole experience of having the subtle color shades that fingerprint and lint the code when you glance at it.\r\n\r\nFor the lesser grades mentioned above, you should get a bit more, but know that the `syntax/[yourlang].vim` has to have enough semantic parsing to make this possible. If you want to go further, you can certainly get a patch in that enhances the syntax parsing inside vim-detailed's `colors/detailed.vim` file.\r\n\r\nFor all other languages, even the ones not listed above, you should at least get:\r\n- Rainbow parens/brackets/curlies (which can be very helpful when the syntax gets deep)\r\n- Quiet comments (grey, because \"a comment is a lie waiting to happen\")\r\n- Strings with gray background (so it looks like a solid chunk)\r\n- Muted colorcolumn (gray instead of GIANT LOUD RED)\r\n- A color palette somewhat consistent with the detailed ones\r\n\r\n## Issues:\r\n\r\n# rking/vim-detailed open issues\r\n  13  More troubleshooting help? 3\r\n  11  Smart Here-docs 1\r\n   9  Detail Python [actual-user-request] 4\r\n   7  Handle t_Co != 256\r\n   6  Pygments Companion\r\n   3  Distinguish Foo and Bar of \"class Foo < Bar\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nThis is wrong:\r\n\r\n![misbehaving](img/misbehaving-detailed.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
